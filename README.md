# STM32 Breakout Board

A minimalist development board for STM32, allowing easy connection to the microcontroller and testing its capabilities.

## Project Description
This board is designed for prototyping with STM32 microcontrollers. It enables easy access to processor pins and testing its functions without requiring ready-made kits such as Nucleo or Discovery. The project includes:

- **Microcontroller:** STM32L476RGT6
- **Power Supply:** 5V (barrel connector)
- **Programming:** STLINK-V3MINIE
- **LED Indicators:** Red LED indicating power supply
- **Easy access to GPIO pins**
